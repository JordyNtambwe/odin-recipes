  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>This bacon-mushroom-Swiss burger recipe combines crisp, smoky bacon, earthy mushrooms, and melty Swiss cheese. The
    herbed mayonnaise adds
    instant sophistication, and toasting the buns gives an extra layer of texture.</p>
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Â½ cup mayonnaise</li>
    <li>3 tablespoons herbes de Provence</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon lemon juice</li>
    <li>8 ounces thick-cut smoked bacon, halved</li>
    <li>8 ounces button mushrooms, sliced</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon soy sauce</li>
    <li>2 pounds lean ground beef</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons garlic granules</li>
    <li>Salt and ground black pepper, to taste</li>
    <li>Slices of swiss cheese</li>
    <li>Hamburger buns</li>
    <li>Burger toppings (such as lettuce, tomato, onion, and pickles)</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Combine mayonnaise, herbes de Provence, Worcestershire sauce, and lemon juice in a small bowl until well mixed.
      Cover bowl and refrigerate herbed mayonnaise until ready to use.</li>
    <li>Cook bacon in a skillet over medium heat, turning occasionally, until crisp. Drain on paper towels. Discard all
      but 1 tablespoon drippings from the skillet.</li>
    <li>Add mushrooms and soy sauce to the skillet; cook over medium heat until mushrooms browned and soft, 5 to 10
      minutes. Drain on paper towels.</li>
    <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate.</li>
    <li>Combine ground beef, garlic granules, salt, and black pepper in a bowl; form into patties.</li>
    <li>Cook patties on the preheated grill, 3 to 5 minutes per side, topping each with 2 slices cheese and covering
      grill to melt cheese during the last 2 minutes of cooking. An instant-read thermometer inserted into centers
      should read 160 degrees F (65 degrees C).</li>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil.</li>
    <li>Arrange hamburger buns on the prepared baking sheet. Lightly toast both sides buns in the preheated oven.
      Transfer buns to serving plates.</li>
    <li>Spread herbed mayonnaise on each bun. Add burgers to bottom buns; add desired toppings and top buns to burgers.
    </li>
