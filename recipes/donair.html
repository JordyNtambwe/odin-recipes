  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>This Canadian street food originating in Halifax, Nova Scotia, consists of spiced, sliced ground beef cooked on a
    rotating
    spit, served in a warm pita with chopped tomatoes and onions, and drizzled with a distinctive sweet sauce made from
    condensed milk,
    sugar, and vinegar.</p>
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons cayenne pepper</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
    <li>Teaspoon onion powder</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
    <li>1 (12 ounce) can evaporated milk</li>
    <li>½ cup white sugar</li>
    <li>¼ cup white vinegar, or to taste</li>
    <li>Pita Bread</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Make the meatloaf: Mix ground beef, cayenne pepper, black pepper, onion powder, garlic powder, salt, paprika,
      and oregano together in a
      large bowl until combined. Shape mixture into a loaf and place on a baking tray; cover with plastic wrap and let
      rest in the
      refrigerator overnight.</li>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
    <li>Bake meatloaf in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the center, about 30 minutes, turning the loaf over
      halfway through cooking.
      An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).
      Allow the meatloaf to cool so it holds together for slicing.</li>
    <li>Meanwhile, make the sauce: Stir evaporated milk and sugar together in a bowl until sugar is dissolved; add
      vinegar, 1 teaspoon at a time,
      to taste. Refrigerate sauce until ready to serve.</li>
    <li>Slice meatloaf into 1/4-inch thick slices; brown each slice in a skillet over medium heat until browned and
      crisp, about 5 minutes per
      side.</li>
    <li>Sprinkle pita bread rounds with a little water; warm briefly in a dry skillet over medium heat.</li>
    <li>To serve: Place several slices of meatloaf into each warmed pita bread; spoon about 2 tablespoons of sauce on
      top and roll into a cone
      shape. Wrap each donair in aluminum foil to keep the sauce from dripping out.</li>
  </ol>
